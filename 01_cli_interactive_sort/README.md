1. Runn the app `node app `

2. Enter the string e.g.:

-  `word1 wrd ard Word1 wORD20 `
-  `127 15 78 85`
-  `127 word1 785 word ` - in this case actions with strings will ignore any numbers. The same way it works with operations that are able to be performed only with digits. The sample as `word123` the program will detect as a string

-  d. Display words in ascending order by number of letters in the word
-  e. Show only unique words
-  f. Display only unique values from the set of words and numbers entered by the user
-  g. This operation will repeat the program inform you that for exit you need to enter `exit`

4. After you perform the operation to sort the string program will repeat itself and log you the whole list of operations. Here you **need to enter new string**
